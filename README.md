# ANN-Model-For-Character-Recognition
This project focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for character recognition, a fundamental task in the field of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. The system is designed to classify handwritten or printed characters into their respective categories by learning patterns from labeled training data.

The workflow of the project begins with data preprocessing, where character images are resized, normalized, and flattened into a format suitable for neural network training. The prepared data is then passed into a feedforward ANN, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. Using backpropagation and optimization algorithms, the ANN learns to minimize classification error and improve its accuracy over multiple training epochs.

To ensure effectiveness, the model is trained on a dataset such as MNIST handwritten digits or a custom character dataset. During training, performance metrics like accuracy and loss are monitored to evaluate how well the network generalizes to unseen data. After training, the model is tested with new samples, demonstrating its ability to correctly identify characters outside of the training set.

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras for model development, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualization of training curves. The repository also includes modular scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation, making it easy to extend or adapt the system.

This character recognition project has a wide range of applications, from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in document digitization, to postal automation, form reading, and intelligent handwriting analysis. Although this implementation focuses on ANN, it also provides a strong foundation for experimenting with more advanced architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can further improve recognition accuracy.

By completing this project, one gains hands-on experience in neural network design, data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, while also understanding practical applications of AI in real-world scenarios.
